        help: Template to use when creating the temporary file/directory.
        long_help: |
            Template to use when creating the temporary file/directory.

            The template may be any file name with some number of X's appended to it.
    - directory:
        help: Make a directory instead of a file.
        long: directory
        short: d
    - quiet:
        help: Fail silently if an error occurs.
        long_help: |
            Fail silently if an error occurs.
            This is useful if a script does not want error output to go to standard error.
        long: quiet
        short: q
    - t:
        help: Create the file/directory in the directory specified by the TMPDIR environment variable if set, otherwise /tmp/.
        long_help: >
            Create the file/directory in the directory specified by the TMPDIR
            environment variable if set, otherwise /tmp/.


            If TEMPLATE doesnot end with X, generate a template using TEMPLATE as a prefix.

            If TEMPLATE does end with X, use it directly as a template.

    - unsafe:
        help: Unsafe mode. Use of this option is discouraged.
        long_help: |
            Operate in ''unsafe'' mode.

            The temp file will be unlinked before mktemp exits.
            This is slightly better than mktemp(3) but still introduces a race condition.

            Use of this option is not encouraged.
