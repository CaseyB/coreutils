## Code of Conduct
Just don't be an pain in anyone's butt üò∏

## How Can I Contribute?
### Reporting Bugs
In the Issues tracker, click in the button `New issue`, then select the `Bug Report` option. After that, add the required information about the bug in the template, and submit.

### Suggesting Enhancements
In the Issues tracker, click in the button `New issue`, then select the `Feature request` option. After that, add the required information about the bug in the template, and submit.

### Pull Requests
After forking and making your changes, always make a Pull Request to the `master` branch with a proper message saying what is changed.

## Styleguides
### Git Commit Messages
* First line should always start with the name of the tool that the code is being modified, followed by `:`.
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

**Git Commit Messages Template**
```
<TOOL/LIB>: <SUBMODULE>: <SUBSUBMODULE>: <MESSAGE>
```

**Git Commit Messages Example**
```
Core: Groups: Blablabla bla bla
```
```
Id: Implement flag '-a'
```

### Tools Styleguide
* Always use `clap` using the `.template/src/cli.rs` as template.
* Always create a `build.rs` that creates every shell completions. (there is a `.template` folder where you can use the `build.rs`, just need to change the YAML file name)
* Every argument have to have the `help` text.
* Help messages should start with upper case letter.
* Every parameter have to have the `long` and `short` options.
* Every tool messages should follow this format: `<tool>: <message>` or `<tool>: <message>: <submessage>`
* Every tool should have exit code the same as the original tools.

### Rust Styleguide
* Don't use nightly only features.
* The code must be formatted with this repository `rustfmt` configuration `rustfmt.toml`, otherwise the CI will fail.
  * Install the toolchain with: `rustup toolchain install nightly` and then format your code with `cargo +nightly fmt`. Be sure that `cargo +nightly fmt -- --check` doesn't print anything.
* Main functions should be the first thing after global use statements and module statements (not module blocks).
* Documentation should always be included when needed, for both functions, methods, modules, etc.
* Tests, when possible, should always be included/updated with your changes.
* Always comment what you're doing if it's not obvious, should be before the code that need explaining.
* Try to be conservative about dependencies, only add if it is very necessary or if it will add good amount of ergonomics with few sub-dependencies. (you can check the dependency tree using `cargo-tree` crate)
  * As for dependencies versions, use `"~<Version>"` for crates below 1.0 and `"^<Version>"` for crates above 1.0.
* Avoid unsafe Rust in the tools code, if necessary, add a function in `coreutils_core` crate with necessary abstractions.
