            This option implies the -d option.

            If the -i option is specified, the user is prompted for confirmation
            before each directory's contents are processed (as well as before
            the attempt is made to remove the directory).

            If the user does not respond affirmatively, the file hierarchy
            rooted in that directory is skipped.
