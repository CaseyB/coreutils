    Display newline, word and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if
    more than one FILE is specified. A word is a non-zero-length sequence of
    characters delimited by white space.


    With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
help_message: Display help information.
version_message: Display version information.
help_short: "?"
args:
    - FILE:
        help: One or more file names.
        required: false
        multiple: true
    - bytes:
        help: Display the byte counts.
        long_help: >
            Display the byte counts.


            If the current locale does not support multibyte characters, this is
            equivalent to the -m option.
        long: bytes
        short: c
    - chars:
        help: Display the character counts.
        long_help: >
            Display the character counts.


            If the current locale does not support multibyte characters, this is
            equivalent to the -c option.
        long: chars
        short: m
    - lines:
        help: Display the newline counts.
        long: lines
        short: l
    - max-line-length:
        help: Display the maximum display width.
        long_help: >
            Display the maximum display width.


            Write the length of the line containing the most bytes (default) or
            characters (when -m is provided) to standard output.


            When more than one file argument is specified, the longest input
            line of all files is reported as the value of the final "total".
        long: max-line-length
        short: L
    - words:
        help: Display the word counts.
        long: words
        short: w
    - pretty:
        help: Output results in a more human readable format.
        long: pretty
        short: p
